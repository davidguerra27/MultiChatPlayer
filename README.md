# TCP MultiThread Chat Server

This is a very simple Java version of a MultiThread Server following the TCP protocol, where various users can be logged, with a lan connection, to the same Chat Room.
The program runs through the terminal so far... but that can be changed(I leave that to you :P).
In this little adventure of mine I was joined by to adventurers who, like me, also dable in dark arts of programming.
These two adventurers go by the name of Luis "the Daddy" Santos and Andre "the Giant" Costa.
